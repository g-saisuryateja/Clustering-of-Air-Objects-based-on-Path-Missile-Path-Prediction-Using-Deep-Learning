# Clustering-of-Air-Objects-based-on-Path-Missile-Path-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
Recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have been used to perform Clustering of Air Objects based on Path and for Missile Path Prediction. For clustering of air objects, LSTM gave r2 score of 0.997 and for missile path prediction, LSTM with 7 epochs gave an r2 score of 0.791.
